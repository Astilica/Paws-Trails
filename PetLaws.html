          <h2>Understanding Pet Laws</h2>
          <p>Owning a pet is a big responsibility, and in Ireland, there are several laws designed to protect the welfare of animals and ensure responsible pet ownership. Here is an overview of some key laws every pet owner should know:</p>

          <h3>Animal Welfare Act 2013</h3>
          <p>This act places a duty of care on pet owners to ensure their animals are properly looked after. Failure to provide food, shelter, or medical care can result in penalties, including fines and imprisonment.</p>

          <h3>Microchipping</h3>
          <p>All dogs in Ireland must be microchipped and registered with an approved database by the age of 12 weeks. This law ensures lost or stolen pets can be reunited with their owners.</p>

          <h3>Dog Licensing</h3>
          <p>Every dog must have a valid dog license. Licenses are available from your local post office or online and must be renewed annually.</p>

          <h3>Control of Dogs</h3>
          <p>Certain breeds are subject to stricter regulations, this includes being muzzled and leashed in public places. Owners must also ensure their dogs do not cause danger to others.</p>

          <h3>Traveling with Pets</h3>
          <p>If traveling with pets, make sure they have the necessary vaccinations and documentation, especially when crossing borders. Ensure they are secured safely in vehicles.</p>
